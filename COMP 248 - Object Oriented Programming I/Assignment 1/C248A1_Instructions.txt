Question 1:Manipulating integer and doubles
â€¨Write a program that reads the numerators and denominators of two fractions into 4 variables of type integer. You can assume that the user will enter non-zero denominators. Your program then outputs the product and the sum of the two fractions as a fraction and as a percentage. 

Question 2:Manipulating variables of type String

Write a program which
1. Display a welcome message.
2. Prompts the user for his/her favorite city which it then stores in
a variable of type String.
3. Store the number of letters in the city name in a variable of type
int.
4. Display the city name as it was entered by the user and the
number of letters in it.
5. Display the city name all in upper case.
6. Display the city name with the second letter in upper-case.
7. Display the city name with the second to last letter in upper-case.
8. Display the city name with the middle letter in upper-case. Note: The middle letter
is the letter at location length() of the word divided by 2.
9. Display a farewell message, so that the user knows that the program has terminated
normally.
